## Building a New Application with SAAS Project
If you're building a new application with SAAS Project, you don't want to "Fork" the template repository on GitHub. Instead, you should:

1. Clone the template repository:

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:esmerino/saas-project.git your_new_project_name
    $ cd your_new_project_name
    ```

2. Run the configuration script:

    ```
    $ bin/configure
    ```
